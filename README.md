## üìù Additional Notes

- **Backend:** This project requires a backend API for user authentication and tracking endpoints.  
  You must also **clone and run the backend repo separately**: [TV-Progress-Tracker (Backend API)](https://github.com/williamGarcia99x/TV-Progress-Tracker.git).  
  **Do not clone it inside this repository**‚Äîkeep it as a separate project folder to avoid nesting repos.  
  Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` in your `.env.local` as needed to match your backend server address.
- **TMDB Usage:** All show/movie data is fetched from TMDB. You must comply with their [terms of use](https://www.themoviedb.org/terms-of-use).
- **Custom Styling:** Colors and UI are customizable via Tailwind config and CSS variables.
